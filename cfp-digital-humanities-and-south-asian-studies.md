# CFP: Digital Humanities and South Asian Studies
April 28, 2017

I am thrilled to be co-editing a special issue of South Asian Review on South Asian studies and digital humanities with Dr. Rahul K. Gairola. The CFP is below.  

Abstracts are due July 30, 2017, with full papers due on February 1, 2018.  

CALL FOR PAPERS  

*Digital Humanities and South Asian Studies*  

*South Asian Review,* the refereed journal of the South Asian Literary Association, invites fresh submissions for its 2018 Special Topic Issue, 39.1: “Digital Humanities and South Asian Studies.” This issue of SAR will be devoted to South Asian and diasporic interventions in digital humanities. As digital humanities scholarship becomes an important part of academic discourse, we view it as invariably affecting South Asian studies in new, exciting, and problematic ways.  Some questions arising from the contact zone are likely to be: How has the digital work on South Asia and diasporic communities addressed, expanded, and challenged its texts, theories, and its tools, pedagogies, and projects?  How are digital archives and scholarly interventions, such as the 1947 Partition Archive, the Sindhi Voices Project, and South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA) drawing on the affordances of digital cultures to complicate narratives of South Asian experience at home and abroad? What are the technical, conceptual, and design challenges unique to digital humanities in South Asian studies? How are new media and social media influencing identity formation in South Asia and diasporic communities?  

We seek articles that refine or complicate our understanding of what “South Asia” can mean and what South Asian studies can do in the digital milieu. Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:

* The challenges and implications of developing digital literary archives of South Asian writers and online repositories for South Asian cultural heritage
* The influence of South Asia’s many languages on digital scholarship
* South Asian diasporic interventions in digital culture
* Digital connectivity and the world of the Indian Ocean
* The role of social media and new media in constructing South Asian identities
* Digital pedagogies and digital literacies in South Asia and throughout diasporic communities
* Queer South Asians and digital culture
* Postcolonial digital humanities
* The affordances of digital scholarship, media, and culture for social justice praxis in South Asia and diasporic communities.
* Digital culture and tools as they complicate notions of the “terrorist”
* Re-thinking the manifestations of Section 377 and digitality in shaping South Asia  

Abstracts of 300 words are invited by the Guest Editors by 30 July 2017. Finished articles of 15-25 pages, prepared in accordance with the MLA Handbook (8th ed.), are to be accompanied by article abstracts (of approx. 100 words) and a 50-word bio-note, both sent as Word documents by 1 February 2018.

The Special Issue of SAR will be guest-edited by Dr. Roopika Risam, Salem State University, MA (USA), email: rrisam [at] salemstate [dot] edu; and Dr. Rahul K. Gairola, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (India), email: rgairola [at] uw [dot] edu. You may address your inquiries to either of the guest editors.
